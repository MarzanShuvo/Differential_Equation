# Differential Equation

This course provided an in-depth overview of powerful mathematical techniques for the analysis of engineering systems. In addition to developing core analytical capabilities, I learned various computational approaches used to solve these problems. Applications was emphasized, including fluid mechanics, elasticity and vibrations, weather and climate systems, epidemiology, space mission design, and applications in control.
